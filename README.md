# .github
The Lab at [the Archives nationales de France](https://www.archives-nationales.culture.gouv.fr/). 

A small team that is working on building and enriching reference archival metadata, including publishing datasets as Linked Open Data.

This organization owns several repos, to manage data or code created by the members of the Lab.

Most of these repos are private by default; once a dataset or project is mature enough, it may be transferred to [https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR](https://github.com/ArchivesNationalesFR) where it will be made public.

In order to get information about what is going on here, or to get access to a repo of this organization, contact <le-lab.archives-nationales@culture.gouv.fr>.
